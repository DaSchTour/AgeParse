  == DESCRIPTION ==
 This extension calculates the number of years plus months plus days between two ISO-8601 formatted
 dates called FROM and TO. These values are specified as attributes to the {{#age}} function. All other
 attributes are optional, incuding:
 from   = ISO-8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) starting date
 to     = ISO-8601 (uuuu-mm-dd) ending date
 format = controls how much of answer is displayed; choices: ymd | ym | y
 left   = character or text to add to front of answer
 right  = character or text to add to end of answer
 errbox = "yes" shows errors as class="errorbox"; "no" shows errors as regular text
 zeronegatives = "yes" shows "0 days" if TO occurs before FROM
